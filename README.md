       # Survey Methodology 
The 2020 Kaggle DS & ML Survey received 20,036 usable responses from participants in 171
different countries and territories. If a country or territory received less than 50 respondents, we
grouped them into a group named “Other” for anonymity.
An invitation to participate in the survey was sent to the entire Kaggle community (anyone
opted-in to the Kaggle Email List). The survey was also promoted on the Kaggle website and on
the Kaggle Twitter channel.
The survey was live from 10/07/2020 to 10/30/2020. We allowed respondents to complete the
survey at any time during that window.
Responses to multiple choice questions (only a single choice can be selected) were recorded in
individual columns. Responses to multiple selection questions (multiple choices can be selected)
were split into multiple columns (with one column per answer choice).
To protect the respondents’ privacy, free-form text responses were not included in the public
survey dataset, and the order of the rows was shuffled (responses are not displayed in
chronological order).
We excluded respondents that were flagged by our survey system as “Spam”.
